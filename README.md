You can create quickly a drupal environment for testing with this script. As it is only for local testing it assumes that the mysql user is root and there is no password. If that is not the case for your local dev environment you have to modify line 5 with the appropriate credentials for mysql.

Also feel free to add and enable modules that you think are important for your development or testing purposes. The modules that are available here are just the ones I find useful as a starting point.
